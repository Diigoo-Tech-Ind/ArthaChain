# Validator/GPU/Storage Certification

## Minimums
- Validators: CPU, RAM, bandwidth requirements; uptime ≥ 99.5%.
- GPU nodes: CUDA-capable, VRAM thresholds per workload class.
- Storage nodes: disk IOPS, capacity, replication capabilities.

## SLAs
- Block participation (validators) ≥ threshold.
- Retrieval latency percentiles (storage) under target.
- Proof submission accuracy (storage) ≥ 99.9%.

## Slash Policy
- Severe violations: double-sign, security breach.
- Operational violations: downtime above threshold (penalized via rewards reduction and badge downgrade).

## Badge Tiers
- Bronze, Silver, Gold based on performance metrics over rolling window.
